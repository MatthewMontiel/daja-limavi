## Our Process

![screenshot](./assets/images/thoughts.png)

## *Description*

This is a music genre cross reference application to help the user discover music they will like. 

## *How to use*

As a user I want to get music recommendations<br>

When I input criteria and click load deck<br>

Then I am presented with recommendations<br>

To use please select three genres and press load deck.<br>
When load deck is pressed the user will then see the shuffle button to get their results.<br>
When the shuffle button is pressed, some Giphy dancers are deployed as well to party as you find some new music!<br>

## *Built With*

- *Bulma* https://bulma.io/<br>
- *Wikipedia* API https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API<br>
- *Giphy* API https://developers.giphy.com/<br>
## *Future Updates*
- As our class goes on and we learn more we want to come back and implement more of what we learn to improve this sites functionality. 
- One of the updates will have clearer ways to find artists as well as genres they are in.
- In the end we would like for this project to become an application capable of playing music and not just sourcing them.
